- Create a proper data abstraction layer (to be used by CLI, daemon, modules...)
- Make collection more generic; currently it's just cisco-oriented
- Introduce a method to download caps based on packet count (i.e. show monitor capture), instead of timed checks
- Update CLI to display/navigate through findings
- Write Pcredz module
- Write ferret module
- Advanced options (e.g. name of capture buffer)
